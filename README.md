# _keypress
keylogger -> Open Sound Control data

# about it.
this can run in the background and will log keypresses globally on your mac and convert them to OSC. 
use port 7000 to connect to it.

# THIS IS NOT A MALICIOUS KEYLOGGER !!! 
although this style of software is malicious by nature, the entirety of this app is for the purpose of controlling audio through OSC.
